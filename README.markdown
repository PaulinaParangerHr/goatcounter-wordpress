Wordpress plugin for [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com). Can be used
with either the hosted goatcounter.com service or when self-hosting GoatCounter.

It's compatible with any version of GoatCounter.

The current status is very basic; more options will be added in later versions.

Installation instructions: clone this repo in the `wp-content/plugins/`
directory and activate it in the WordPress admin panel.

This should give you a "GoatCounter" menu item in the sidebar; you'll need to
fill in you site's URL on the settings page before it works.
